# Weather Way - Milestone Project 2

## HTML/CSS/JS ESSENTIALS - Interactive Frontend Website

Weather Way flips the script on traditional activity planning by placing the weather at the heart of your decision-making process. Here's how it works: you start by checking the weather for your desired location and date. With this information in hand, our platform then invites you to explore a diverse array of activities that perfectly align with the forecast. Whether you're keen on enjoying live music under the stars on a clear night, cozying up in a charming coffee shop during a drizzle, or wandering through the quiet halls of a museum on a rainy afternoon, Weather Way makes it effortless. Our unique approach ensures that the weather guides you towards making the best out of your day, turning what could have been a deterrent into an opportunity to discover the perfect activities for any condition.

## Design Process

In designing the weather app, the primary goal was to create an interface that was not only functional but also visually engaging and intuitive for users. The decision to use specific color palettes for both the website and the weather cards was driven by the desire to enhance user experience and convey information through color effectively.

The website itself employs a sophisticated and modern color scheme with shades of dark blue (#0C1330), muted purple (#474554), soft lavender (#ACA7CB), and light grey (#E0E0E0). This palette was chosen to create a calming and professional backdrop that allows the vibrant weather cards to stand out, ensuring users can quickly gauge the weather outlook without being overwhelmed by the interface's base colors.

For the weather cards, the use of gradients serves a dual purpose: aesthetically pleasing transitions and a visual representation of weather conditions. The gradients ranging from sunny, cloudy, snowy, rainy, foggy, to stormy weather conditions utilize specific color schemes to evoke the essence of each weather type, making the app not just visually appealing but also highly informative at a glance.

The integration of the Google Places API with autocomplete functionality significantly enhances the user experience by ensuring the accuracy of city entries. This feature, coupled with the app's ability to fetch international weather data from the OpenWeather API using latitude and longitude coordinates, allows for a globally comprehensive weather service. Users can search for activities based on the weather, making the app a versatile tool for daily planning.

Additionally, a "Contact Us" form was implemented, leveraging the EmailJS API, to allow users to send emails directly through the app. This feature fosters a direct line of communication between the user and the app developers, enhancing support and user engagement.

In summary, the design process of the weather app was deeply influenced by the desire to create a user-centric interface. The thoughtful selection of color schemes, the integration of essential APIs for accuracy and global weather data, and the inclusion of a contact mechanism, all contribute to a comprehensive and intuitive user experience. The app not only serves as a tool for checking the weather but also as a guide for planning activities, reflecting a seamless blend of aesthetic appeal and functionality.

## Bugs

Encountering a spacing issue after the paragraph with the ID welcomeMessage, I initially toggled visibility using visibility = hidden/visible to hide and show the paragraph. I realized that the containing div wasn't disappearing, but I wasn't sure how to resolve this. After some research and consulting with ChatGPT, I learned to create a function that checks if the content is truthy after trimming, as an empty string is considered falsy. Following this advice, I switched from using visibility = hidden/visible to style.display = none for showing and hiding content.

While integrating the Google Places Autocomplete API, I initially struggled to get it working. After delving into the Google Console, I discovered I was using the incorrect script URL. Once corrected, I noticed the API returned more information than I needed; I only wanted city names, but it provided full addresses. Further investigation led me to specify the types object as cities to narrow down the results to my requirements.

I faced another challenge when displaying the Google Map. Despite assigning the map div an ID of map, my CSS incorrectly used the . prefix for classes instead of # for IDs, preventing the JavaScript code from finding the map ID. This frustrating oversight was eventually clarified through student tutoring and reminded me of the importance of using IDs for unique elements and classes for multiple elements that share the same styling or functionality.

Working with the Open Weather Map API presented a significant challenge, as I couldn't get it to function correctly. Though I believed my URL was accurate, it wasn't until I signed up for a student developer account and received a different URL that I began receiving data. This breakthrough was a relief.

Lastly, the presentation of weather data in my app was initially less polished than I preferred, with temperatures and precipitation levels displaying too many decimal places. Recalling the round() method from my notes and applying it greatly improved the data's appearance.

Throughout the development of my app, I relied heavily on console.log for debugging and experimentation. This process has dramatically improved my understanding of JavaScript. ChatGPT has been instrumental in guiding me through various challenges and enhancing my problem-solving skills.

During testing, while running the JS through JSlint, in my fectchWeather function, it suggested to include "responce" in parenthese (.then((response) => response.json())).

One noticeable issue I encountered was that although my app functioned properly on a computer and was designed to work on mobile devices with smaller screens, it failed to operate correctly when actually accessed from a mobile device. I wasn't completely sure what caused this problem, but I observed that after running my JavaScript through JSLint and correcting a significant syntax error where I had not i included "response" in parentheses, including it subsequently rectified the issue. Consequently, my app started working on mobile devices as well, which I'm very pleased about.

Although not a bug, I initially wanted to have 3 buttoms, one which show the weather for today, then another for a 3 day forcast, and another for a 5 day forcast. I did manage to get this to work but decided to remove it because it didn't make sence to have these three options. Seeing the weather for 5 days gives you everything you need.

## Testing

I ran the website through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). No errors were found.

I ran the website through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). There are errors from Bootstrap, and warnings about the transform used in my css.

I also tested my js through [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/). I asked Chat GPT to run thorugh the warnings. I learnt that JSlnt doesn't like it when lines of code has more than 80 characters. I have my VS code set to 120 which i'm happy with. I also learnt that JSLint doesn't like single quote, but i've chosen to leave my JS with single quotes and that it doesn't seem to like the arrow function method. It seems it prefer the reidutional way for more complex function, but i don't think my funtion is very complex. There were a few spacing warning which I corrected and a peice of code which advised I should inclose in parentheses which I did.

I conducted extensive cross-browser testing, meticulously reviewing the website in various browsers. During this process, I systematically clicked on every link on each page to verify their functionality and ensure a consistent, error-free user experience across different platforms.

1. Google Chrome
2. Microsoft Edge
3. Opera
4. Mozilla Firefox
5. DuckDuckGo

I did notice a few styling issues on smaller screen resolutions which I corrected. Nothing which would have caused an issue, more just for visual appearance.

I also ran each page through [Lighthouse via Microsoft Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/accessibility/lighthouse) aiming to significantly elevate the overall quality of the website. This comprehensive analysis helped identify and address key aspects of performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO to enhance the site's effectiveness and user experience. I ran this for both desktop and mobile.

## Credits

* My mentor Spencer Barriball.
  * Spencer has been great in reminding to make notes throughout my code and put my mind at ease that my project was a good ida.
* When searching for an idea for this MP2, I came across [Steve Griffith on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveGriffith-Prof3ssorSt3v3). I must give alot of credit to him because without his vidow, I wouldn't understand what I know now. Some of the code I used was his, but I made sure I made it unique to my project and that I understood everything I was doing.
